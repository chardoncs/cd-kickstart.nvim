# Charles' Neovim Kickstarter

A Neovim kickstart with options.

I wrote this because I need a common configuration base for different devices,
but without too much personalization. That is, balancing personalization with generalization.
Because I use different devices for different things.

This kickstarter is not perfect. Please tell me if you have
any suggestion.
